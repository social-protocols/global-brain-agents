agents throw a weighted coin

we know the true parameter of the coin

agents only have access to their own coin toss initially

Can the agents figure out the true parameter of the coin as a collective without anyone having enough individual information to figure it out on their own?

Can the agents agree on the true heads probability of the coin?
